//--------------REGISTRATION FORM LAYOUT--------------//

    SECTION. PLACE WHERE IMPROVEMENT APPLIES                                                                                                                         

Open the registration form

ACTUAL RESULT 
Registration form is visible on the right side of screen. Form takes ~40% of the screen. First impression of the page goes to awards. 
If the screen is smaller, chatbot pop-up screen covers the registration form  

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENT
Change the layout. Registration form goes in the middle and to the top, the awards goes bellow the registration form. In this way first impression of the page goes to the registration form.

REASONING
 Awards are nice to have, but the registration form is not the place to show awards, since most of the time registration form is second or third page, the user visits. Besides on the laptop view L 1440px, chatbot pop-up partially covers registration form, which for me personally looks annoying.
