AUTOMATED TESTING APPROACH:

1. Run manual testing of the registration form.
2. Inspect the process and identify the areas that can be easily repeated.
3. Open DevTools, search for the relevant elements, and check if locators are easy to find.
4. Generate scenarios that could be automated.
5. Use Selenium IDE, Katalon Recorder, or a similar tool to mimic the scenarios and determine how the automated test scripts could work.
6. Present the team with potential automation scripts.
7. If some flows are approved, ask the developers to add specific attributes like 'data-testid' to facilitate selector identification.
8. Create automation scripts using Playwright, Cypress, or a similar tool that simplifies script creation and maintenance, and facilitates report generation.
9. Test the scripts and evaluate whether they provide sufficient and accurate results.
10. Run the scripts periodically within the regression testing scope or integrate them into CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.

In the registrationflow.spec.ts file, there is a fragment of the flow that mimics incorrect message display when an incorrect email is used. The test fails because, when I run it manually, I can see the message. However, when running through the tool, reCaptcha is invoked, and I was unable to find a workaround for it.
The functionsAndData.ts file contains test data and a randomEmail function.
