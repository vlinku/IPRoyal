The checklist of scenarios for the test of the registration form:


1. It is possible to visit the registration page.
2. It is possible to create a new account by filling in all mandatory fields (in both English and Chinese languages).
3. Registration with Google or LinkedIn is possible if the user's browser remembers logins to those systems.
4. Registration with Google or LinkedIn in Incognito mode should not remember the user's login.
5. The user can create multiple accounts with similar emails (e.g., a company has multiple emails with the same domain, such as JohnDoe@iproyal.com and NewUser@iproyal.com).
6. When an account is created, it should not be possible to create another identical account.
7. Login is not possible by typing an incorrect password (not according to the pop-up requirements).
8. Error messages for the email address field appear when an incorrect email address is entered.
9. The visual design of the form (labels, fields, buttons, links, design elements) is in place and meets the specifications.
10. Responsive design (Widescreen, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile) is correct and adheres to the specifications.
11. Error messages are displayed when form fields are filled incorrectly.
12. The password field is hidden by default but can be made visible and hidden again.
13. When typing XSS scripts instead of names, registration should fail.
